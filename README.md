Vibe - Social Event & Connection App
Vibe is a modern, real-time social application built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It allows users to discover and join local events, connect with other attendees through a unique post-event rating system, and engage in both group and private one-on-one chats.

The app is powered by a robust Firebase backend, providing real-time data synchronization, authentication, push notifications, and scalable storage for user-generated content.

Architecture Diagram
The application follows a modern client-server architecture using Firebase as the backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform. The diagram below illustrates the flow of data and interactions between the client, backend services, and automated functions.
